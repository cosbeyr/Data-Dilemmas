# On actor-network theory

- Agencies -- three resources
   - naturality, link with nature
   - sociality, tie them with social fabric
   - semiotic construction, relate them to building of meaning

*actor-network theory* - attempt to invent a vocabulary; a change of theories to describe essences; a change of topology (in terms of nodes that have as many dimensions as they have connections); aims at explaining the effects accounted for by those traditional words without having to buy the ontology, topology or politics; starts from irreducible, incommensurably, unconnected localities which sometime end in provisionally commensurable connections; AT does not attempt to fill in what is in between local pocket of orders or in between filaments relating these contingencies

*actor* - can be non-human, non-individual entities; something that acts or to which activity is granted by others; can be anything provided that it is granted to be the source of an action; actors not fixed entities, rather "flows", circulating objects undergoing trials, stability comes from action

*connections* - based on a multitude of theories and practices (e.g. geography); proximity and distance of many kinds

### Common Network Misconceptions
- Common technical meaning doesn't work
    - actor-networks lack these characteristics
    - may be local, have no compulsory paths, no strategically positioned nodes
- AT has very little to do with social networks
    - AT distrusts vacgue all encompassing sociological terms
    - AT aims at describing the very nature of societies
    - AT aims at accounting for the very essence of societies and natures

### Network Properties
* in order to obtain the effects of distance, proximity, hierarchies, connectedness, outsidernes and surfaces, supplementary work must be done -- e.g. the actor

- *far/close* - elements which are close when disconnected may be infinitely remote if their connections are analyzed
    - EXAMPLE: I CAN SEE A SPIT ACROSS THE WATER BUT IT TAKES TWO MILES TO WALK TO IT
    - geographical proximity is the result of a science (geography), profession (geographers), practice (mapping system, measuring triangulation)
- *small/large scale* - metaphor of connections
    - a network is never bigger, it is longer or more intensely connected
    - no a priori order relation
    - the scale, that is, the type, number and topography of connections is left to the actors themselves
- *inside/outside* - all boundary without inside or outside
   - is a connection established between two elements?

### Semiotics
- meaning production, discourse, text
- every entity, including the self, society, nature, every relation, every action, can be understood as "choices" or "selection"
- AT is a method to describe the deployment of associations
    - "places the burden of theory on the recording not on the specific shape that is recorded"
