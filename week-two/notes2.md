# DesignX: Complex Sociotechnical Systems
- I LIKE THAT ONE OF THE KEYWORDS IS "MUDDLING THROUGH" 
- design challenges of complex sociotechnical systems
    - major challenges arise during implementation (political, economic, cultural, organizational, structural problems overwhelm)
- designers must play an active role in implementation and develop solutions through small, incremental steps
    - requires tolerance for existing constraints/tradeoffs, modularity
- satisfice rather than optimize

*muddling through* - a form of incrementalism

### Complex Sociotechnical Problems
*complex social systems* (healthcare, transportation, government, policy implementation, environmental protection) - have many components, interactions are critical to system's behavior; design field contributes to efficiency of these systems
    - requires problem-finding and observational skills, ability to manage iterations of prototyping and testing

---

### DesignX Problems: An Example
- departments within the same organization can have very different structures/characteristics/patterns
- e.g. Hospital departments
    - Radiation Oncology: complexity of establishing long-term compatibility across multiple disciplines/departments/individuals; shifting disease trajectory requires multiple imaging/testing; 
    - Emergency: events are unscheduled, sometimes work must begin before relevant specialists arrive

### What Makes a Design Problem DesignX?
- findings from sociotechnical systems theory, human factors, ergonomics community, cognitive systems engineering


***The Psychology of Human Behavior and Cognition***
- human psychology and the natural human tendency to seek simple explanations and answers even for complex problems; why people have such difficulty comprehending and dealing with issues

*Not Human Psychology System Design*
- complex systems: to aid component of human or societal life
- disasters: impacted and caused by lack of good human-factors and human-centered design INDEED++
    - incompatibility between people's capabilities and system requirements (e.g. people asked to monitor sparse events over long times)
    - people asked to provide accuracy and precision required by technology
- tendency to design complex sociotechnical systems around technological requirements rather than the people who will use them


**Human Cognition**
- people are good at visualizing and understanding systems with independent components and linear causal relationships
- people are not good at understanding complex systems with non-linear, multiple feedback loops and long latencies -> leads to oversimplification of complex systems to seek straightforward and simple answers 
- I LIKE HOW THEY FOLLOW UP THE LAST POINT ABOUT HOW HUMANS AREN'T THE PROBLEM WITH HOW HUMANS ARE THE PROBLEM

***The Social, Political and Economic Framework of Complex Sociotechnical Systems***

- fundamental characteristics of sociotechnical systems that require most solutions to involve complex tradeoffs; any approach will be both beneficial and harmful

**Multiple Disciplines and Perspectives**
- each discipline brings different expertise/perspective, emphasizes different aspects of the problem, different value systems, speak different technical languages (same terms, different meanings)
- must compromise on individual goals for the greater good, lack of compromise breeds disruption


**Mutually Incompatible Constraints**
- constraints: numerous, contradictory, not readily comparable
- arise from regulatory agencies, laws, economic/business issues, safety concerns, efficiency/productivity, cultural practice


***The Technical Issues Contributing to DesignX Problem Complexity***

**Non-Independence of Elements**
