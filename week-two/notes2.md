# DesignX: Complex Sociotechnical Systems
- I LIKE THAT ONE OF THE KEYWORDS IS "MUDDLING THROUGH" 
- design challenges of complex sociotechnical systems
    - major challenges arise during implementation (political, economic, cultural, organizational, structural problems overwhelm)
- designers must play an active role in implementation and develop solutions through small, incremental steps
    - requires tolerance for existing constraints/tradeoffs, modularity
- satisfice rather than optimize

*muddling through* - a form of incrementalism

### Complex Sociotechnical Problems
*complex social systems* (healthcare, transportation, government, policy implementation, environmental protection) - have many components, interactions are critical to system's behavior; design field contributes to efficiency of these systems
    - requires problem-finding and observational skills, ability to manage iterations of prototyping and testing

---

### DesignX Problems: An Example
- departments within the same organization can have very different structures/characteristics/patterns
- e.g. Hospital departments
    - Radiation Oncology: complexity of establishing long-term compatibility across multiple disciplines/departments/individuals; shifting disease trajectory requires multiple imaging/testing; 
    - Emergency: events are unscheduled, sometimes work must begin before relevant specialists arrive

---

### What Makes a Design Problem DesignX?
- findings from sociotechnical systems theory, human factors, ergonomics community, cognitive systems engineering


***The Psychology of Human Behavior and Cognition***
- human psychology and the natural human tendency to seek simple explanations and answers even for complex problems; why people have such difficulty comprehending and dealing with issues

*Not Human Psychology System Design*
- complex systems: to aid component of human or societal life
- disasters: impacted and caused by lack of good human-factors and human-centered design INDEED++
    - incompatibility between people's capabilities and system requirements (e.g. people asked to monitor sparse events over long times)
    - people asked to provide accuracy and precision required by technology
- tendency to design complex sociotechnical systems around technological requirements rather than the people who will use them


**Human Cognition**
- people are good at visualizing and understanding systems with independent components and linear causal relationships
- people are not good at understanding complex systems with non-linear, multiple feedback loops and long latencies -> leads to oversimplification of complex systems to seek straightforward and simple answers 
- I LIKE HOW THEY FOLLOW UP THE LAST POINT ABOUT HOW HUMANS AREN'T THE PROBLEM WITH HOW HUMANS ARE THE PROBLEM

***The Social, Political and Economic Framework of Complex Sociotechnical Systems***

- fundamental characteristics of sociotechnical systems that require most solutions to involve complex tradeoffs; any approach will be both beneficial and harmful

**Multiple Disciplines and Perspectives**
- each discipline brings different expertise/perspective, emphasizes different aspects of the problem, different value systems, speak different technical languages (same terms, different meanings)
- must compromise on individual goals for the greater good, lack of compromise breeds disruption


**Mutually Incompatible Constraints**
- constraints: numerous, contradictory, not readily comparable
- arise from regulatory agencies, laws, economic/business issues, safety concerns, efficiency/productivity, cultural practice


***The Technical Issues Contributing to DesignX Problem Complexity***

**Non-Independence of Elements**
- sociotechechnical systems: n-way interdependencies are common
    - interdependencies often unknown, discovered later


**Non-Linear Causal Relations: Feedback**
- feedback changes behavior of the system, must be analyzed for emergent behavior
    - can change the operating characteristics
- inter-relationships among components are more important than the componens
- THIS SEEMS TO RELATE TO ACTOR-NETWORK THEORY


**Long and Unpredictable Latencies**
-  feedback loops are often uncertain with long/unpredictable latencies


**Multiple Scale Sizes**
- problems require understanding/action from micro/macro sizes, short/long time periods
    - micro/short: interface elements, procedural steps
    - macro/long: supply chains, standards, legal contraints

**Dynamically Changing Operating Characteristics**
- due to: component failure, system modification, component enhancement
- deliberate (systems that self-adjust and "learn")
- mechanical, structural
- simultaneous changes are challenging to deal with

### Approaches to Complex Sociotechnical Problems
- sociotechnical systems: involve complex, non-linear mix of people and technology
- human-centered design - analyzes the operation from the point of view of individual participants
    - observations from real behavior, analyzing and following each individual job category
- designers illuminate issues absent from traditional systems analyses
    - discover underlying causes of the human behavior and redesign the system to eliminate them 
    - THIS SEEMS CHALLENGING WITH LARGE SYSTEMS -- BREAK APART?

**role of design caveats**
- collaboratively work with systems thinkers and other actors
- develop new ways of dealing with complex systems
- lack of consideration of human psychology is a major cause of difficulty
- designers focus on developing end result but with complex systems they must also be a member of the implementation team


---

### Implementation: The Core Difficulty
- traditional design methods: observation, finding core issues, repeated interventions (prototypes), iteration == appropriate, successful
- implementation issues lie in complex human and social elements, lack of understanding of fundamental human capabilities
    - different perspectives of those involved in the analysis and decision making process 
- require compromises: numerous technical, social and cultural adjustments
- designers must address during design stage
- HOW DO WE GET DESIGNERS INVOLVED IN IMPLEMENTATION?
- THE AUTHORS SEEM TO BE GOING BACK AND FORTH ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS ARISING DURING DESIGN OR IMPLEMENTATION PHASE


---

### Moving Forward
- "limited capability of humans to fully comprehend complex systems leads them naturally to the construction of systems that they can understand, even if imperfectly"
- we tend to build systems that we can decompose, simplify or approximate by linearization
    - success takes decades to come by (e.g. healthcare)
- each component develops over time (relatively self-contained and understood)
    - the structure of these systems is questionable at best
    - mostly modular
    - ARE THE AUTHORS OPPOSED TO LINEARITY?


---

### Muddling Through
- secret: divide and conquer -- avoid trying to construct or redesign
    - modularity and numerous small, incremental steps
- *incrementalism* - process of moving forward in small, considerable steps, fitting the opportunities offered by each successive present
    - major projects involve so many cultural issues, changes in work practices, changes to division of work across categories
- WHAT ABOUT CONSTANTLY CHANGING LANDSCAPES?
- failure of a small step does not lead to failure of entire effort
- *muddling through* - acting opportunistically, "satisfice" rather than optimize
- new design philosophy: modular, multiple steps, relatively independent parts, incremental changes to be implentented, linkages designed for flexibility
- FLEXIBILITY IS BIG


---

- try for modularity
- decompose into quasi-independent modules for a 'good enough' solution
- pay attention to social, cultural and political issues
- deep analysis, incremental muddling through, satisficing
- design to allow for compromise: co-design, tolerance and modularity
