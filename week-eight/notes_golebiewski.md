# Data Voids: Where Missing Data Can Easily Be Exploited

**data voids** - "occur when obscure search queries have few results associated
with them, making them ripe for exploitation by media manipulators with
ideological, economic, or political agendas" (2)
- "... media manipulators using search engine optimization techniques to get
  their website ranked highly or get their videos recommended"
- "...conspiracy theorists, white nationalists, and a range of other extremist
  groups"


**breaking news** - optimized to terms that are suddenly spiking
- big problem with news on the internet today
- piques interest only momentarily, until another wave comes

**strategic new terms** - in order to introduce newcomers to problematic content
and frames
- thse "strategically optimized information ecosystem[s]" make these terms seem
  more credible

**outdated terms** - an opening for manipulators to produce content that
exploits search engines' dependence on freshness

**fragmented concepts** - manipulators can segment searchers into different
information worlds
- I only see left-wing views on social media
- I have one facebook friend who is a right-wing Trump supporter and it always
  shocks me when I see the posts they comment on - I always try to read them to
understand their perspective but because it's only one group talking about the
same thing they don't explain why, I think that's why I find myself looking for
left-wing views to show up and yell at the others which doesn't happen and
probably wouldn't accomplish anything anyway

**problematic queries** - unless high quality content is introduced to
contextualize or outrank such problematic content
- what is "high quality"

**

- COMMONALITY: OPTIMIZATION, IT'S ALL RELATED TO STATISTICS AND MACHINE
  LEARNING, EXPLOITATION OF AN INFRASTRUCTURE DESIGNED WITH OTHER PURPOSES IN
MIND, NOT SECURED AGAINST THESE VOIDS 


### Managing Data Voids
- "Major search engines consistently struggle to alter their systems so that
  they return high quality results under a constant barrage of manipulation
attempts" (43)
- "data voids [are] regularly exploited by media manipulators determined to
  shape information in their interests"
- HOW INVESTED IS A COMPANY LIKE GOOGLE IN FIXING THIS? DO THEY BENEFIT?
