# The Manipulation of Social Media Metadata

- "describes how manipulators use data craft to create disinformation with
  falsified metadata" (2) (platform activity signals)

**metadata** - "designation ... can change depending on who is using the data in
question and for what purposes ... the names that represent aggregated data" (2)
- "make up the structures, standards, and tools for naming data by labeling how
  a digital object is generated, stored, and can be circulated in networked
communication systems" (5,7)


**data craft** - "practices that create, rely on, or even play with the
proliferation of data on social media by engagign with new computational and
algorithmic mechanisms of organization and classification" (3)
- manipulating metadata; playing with the features and automated operations of
  platforms
- "often skillful, targeted, and organized around common fault lines in platform
  features" (3)

### Introduction
"For users and platforms alike, it is getting harder to discern 'real' users
  and authentic account activities from fake, spammy, and malicious
manipulations" (4)

"Manipulators are getting craftier at evading moderation efforts built upon
these metadata categories by using platform features in unexpected ways" (7)

### One Person's Metadata Are Another Person's Data
 "These engagement activities are layers of user generated context that, when
  aggregated by platforms, reveal new insights about how people communicate" (8)
    - METADATA IS FORM OF COMMUNICATION - IS EVERYTHING METADATA? (CAN
      EVERYTHING BE USED AS METADATA DEPENDING ON THE QUESTIONS YOU ARE ASKING)
    - AUTHENTIFICATION: IT'S CLEAR THAT WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO IDENTIFY HUMANS ON
      THE INTERNET, THE RULES ARE CONSTANTLY CHANGING

"Patterns, or 'signatures,' embedded within metadata are just as unique in
identifying account users as the content of social media they post" (9)


### Conclusion
- "we can identify and read many additional metadata fields by examining
  developer's documentation, platform policies, and terms of service" (22)
- "Researchers ... can develop this craft by considering the contexts in which
  social media data are created, collected, and named" (22)
- "Computer scientists and digital preservation scholars have argued that the
  long-term 'changiness' and decay of metadata after it's been collected from
platform APIs reverals a massive vulnerability in the persistence of social
media" (23)
- "That vulnerability is the inability to preserve the context, data, and
  metadata from manipulation campaigns as evidence of disinformation spread in
platforms for researchers, journalists, policy makers, and historians" (23)
