### This Problem Needs An Iterative Solution and I'm Already Tired

Acker’s publication attempts to define “metadata” and introduces the idea of “data craft.” Acker argues that the designation of metadata “can change depending who is using the data in question and for what purposes” but ultimately defines it as “the names that represent aggregated data” (Acker, 2). It seems like anything can be used as metadata depending on the method and the questions you are asking. When thinking about metadata, I like the idea that “these engagement activities are layers of user generated context that, when aggregated by platforms, reveal new insights about how people communicate” (8). This statement as well as the idea of “social steganography” make me think about how dynamic the ways we communicate are. Over a longer period of time it’s easier to see these shifts (e.g. writing letters, landlines) and as we further progress through this technological age, the shifts are more rapid and nuanced. When Acker stated that “for users and platforms alike, it is getting harder to discern ‘real’ users and authentic account activities” (4) it reminded me of the papers related trust and privacy we read a few weeks ago. Can we as researchers use metadata to help determine genuine, human accounts from fake bots? An issue I see with this is the eternal game of cat and mouse that could ensue in which we find a new piece of metadata to accurately discern a human from a bot and then the bad actors find a way to exploit it. 

The Data Voids report defines that data voids “occur when obscure search queries have few results associated with them, making them ripe for exploitation by media manipulators with ideological, economic, or political agendas” (Golebiewski, 2). The paper goes on to describe five types of data voids. What interested me is the commonality of optimization in each of the types identified. Since search engines and recommender systems are built with machine learning and statistics, it has become an infrastructure that is easily exploited and there is nothing in place currently to secure these technologies. This publication points out that most users of popular search engines do not go beyond the first page of results. Later on in the article, the authors point out that “data voids [are] regularly exploited by media manipulators determined to shape information in their interests” (43).  It bothers me to see that now Google, for example, includes 1-3 ads on the first page of the search results. How invested is a company like Google in fixing these issues? Do they benefit from the existence of data voids? Going back to the Acker piece on metadata, I see the same issue here that was pointed out there; namely, that bad actors will continue to find ways to introduce misinformed or directed information; unless the search engine infrastructure changes drastically, more and more data voids will be introduced and wreak havoc.
