# Networked Privacy

"I made a decision about the privacy of my data that affects numerous people who
are implicated but who have no say" (348)

- data and privacy are increasingly networked
- genetic, social, locational
- "permission" NOT ALWAYS SUBJECT TO FORMALITY OR REQUIRED

"Our data also provides a probabilistic image of who we are based on comparisons
to other people" BASIS OF SECURITY ISSUES WITH ML

"Our interpreted selves aren't simply the product of our own actions and tastes;
they're constructed by recognizing similar patterns across millions of people"
(349)
THIS IS THE PROBLEM: WE ONLY CAPTURE THE MEAN, THE OUTLIERS AREN'T REPRESENTED
WITH ML

"We are the product of the people we know and the socio-cultural environment in
which we are situated" (349) !! MAYBE THERE IS SOMETHING HERE TO STUDY BUT I
THINK WE NEED TO KEEP FOCUS ON MOTIVATIONS AND THE SEEDY MOTIVATIONS OF OTHERS
WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE

### Control and Interpretation

**control** - assumes that people have agency (power to assert control wihtin a
situation); assumes that people have the knowledge and skills to truly control
information; we cannot rely on control in the networked age

**networked privacy sans control** - "focusing on permission at the data
acquisition level is not going to be viable" 

1. limit access to content (achieve privacy by technical means, "keep out") 
2. **social steganography** - work to limit access to meaning; "pronouns and in-joikes, cultural references
and implicit links to unmediated events to share encoded messages that are for
all intents and purposes wholly inaccessible to outsiders" (349)
    - only those who are in the know have the necessary information to look for
      and interpret the information provided
    - misinterpretation: "still subject to advertising and personalization based
      on what they post" I LIKE THINKING OF ALGORITHMS AS NOSY PARENTS

"alternate models for dealing with networked privacy ... shifting to a model
that focuses on usage and interpretation" (349) 
- EVERY MODEL WE BUILD INTERPRETS DATA -- NEED MORE HUMAN FEEDBACK AND
  EXPLANATION?
- "What are the mechanisms by which people can challenge how they've been
  interpreted?" (349)

### Looking Backwards, Moving Forward
- "categories become untenable as an organizational structure because people's
  lives are interwoven with others' lives" (350)
- "The data that underpins networked sociality and algorithmic life connects
  people across numerous axes time and time again"
- "Expecting that people can assert individual control ... reinforces the power
  of those who already have enough status and privilege to meaningfully assert
control over their own networks" (350)


"We need to develop models that position networks, groups, and communities at
the center of our discussion"

WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE ACTIONS OF ONE PERSON CAN AFFECT THE OTHERS,
BUILDING A MODEL TO REPRESENT EACH PERSON INDIVIDUALLY IS UNETHICAL - IS IT FAIR
FOR US TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT SOMEONE BASED ON DATA ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE? 

IT IS IMPORTANT FOR SOCIAL SCIENTISTS TO UNDERSTAND THE PATTERNS OF OUR SOCIETY.
BUT SOCIALI SCIENTISTS ALSO CONSIDER THE OUTLIERS, THE PEOPLE THAT DON'T FIT THE
PATTERN AND THAT'S IMPORTANT IN ML AS WELL. WE ARE NOT GETTING THE FULL PICTURE
IF WE ONLY THINK ABOUT THE MEAN. 

HOW DOES PRIVACY FACTOR IN? A COMMON GOAL OF MUCH OF SOCIETY IS TO HAVE PRIVACY.
BOYD POINTS OUT THAT YOUNGER GENERATION IS FINDING NEW AVENUES OF PRIVACY
WITHOUT ACTUALLY CHANGING THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA. I
THINK AS TECHNOLOGISTS BUILDING HUMAN MODELS WE NEED TO TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT
REORGANIZE OUR MOTIVATIONS WITH AN ETHICAL LENS? THE ONUS SHOULD BE ON US AS ML
