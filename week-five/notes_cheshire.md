# Online Trust, Trustworthiness, or Assurance?

- "the future shape of the Internet will depend on whether we build assurance
  structures to limit and control ambiguity or allow trust to emerge in the
presence of risk and uncertainty" (Cheshire, 49).
- "trust is relevant only when risk and uncertainty exist together ... trust is
  a complex human response to situations that are rife with risk and
uncertainty" (50)
- "the Internet is a complex arrangement of layered trust relationships,
  including small networks among hardware systems, protocols tha toften presume
reliable relationships between these networks, human administrators who
configure and maintain the disparate networks, and, finally, the end users who
operate personal computers and devices to interact with other humans and
systems" (50)
    - THE INTERNET IS AN INCREDIBLY COMPLEX SYSTEM

### TRUST

**interpersonal trust** - human to human; develops over time in a direct
relationship leading to an enduring relationship of direct/indirect interactions 

**significant trust relationships** - each party enapsulates the other's
      interests

**system trust** - human to system

- Online dating and interpersonal trust: SEEMS LIKE IT STARTS IN A MORE INDIRECT
  MANNER 

**trust** - attitude or believe we have about those who are trustworthy

### TRUSTWORTHINESS

**trustworthiness** - characteristic or property of an individual; assessment of
this does not require prior firsthand communication or experience IS THIS
INSTINCTUAL OR CAN IT DEVELOP OVER TIME?
- infer trustworthiness: "explicit or implicit third-party reputation
  information" (52) -- vulnerable to exploitation, deception and
misinterpretation

**explicit reputation info** - ratings, reviews, assessments of qualities based
on prior personal experience

**implicit reputation info** - signals, cues, traces from individual's prior
actions tha tmight correlate with future behavior 
 
- assessing trustworthiness == deciding whether to take a risk with that person
- "email addresses, domain names, and other featuers imply trustworthiness in
  the absence of other available attributes" (52) 
- "nonrepeated interactions between individuals with no prior communication are
  not based on trust: they are acts of risk-taking" (52)
- online forums: trustworthiness is essential, relational trust is impossible

"signalling one's intentions through an initial act of risk-taking is critical
in online interactions when incomplete information ... makes it difficult to
assess the trustworthiness of others" (52)

**risk-taking** - can act as a signal when individuals intentionally give up
something of value without any explicit form of assurance
- "sending money before an item has shipped sends a clear signal that the buyer
  believes the seller is trustworthy" (52) DOES THIS ACTUALLY AFFECT THE SENDER?
HOW DO BAD ACTORS FACTOR IN?

"Those who show that they are willing to take a chance online open themselves to
risk; however, the long-term payoff is a kind of online social intelligence that
rewards risk-taking with new opportunities" (53)
- YOU SAY NEW OPPORTUNITIES, I SAY EXPLOITATION?
- WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS? I SEE VERY, VERY FEW

- "The occurrence of ongoing risk-taking in the presence of uncertainty makes
  trust both possible and relevant. It is the process of risk-taking with the
same individual over time that separates one-time assessments of trustworthiness
from interpersonal trust" (53)

### COOPERATION AND TRUST

1. "trust is required to produce cooperation, which in turn helps create
productive societies" (53)
2. "trust exists at the interpersonal level to produce 'social order and to
lower the costs of monitoring and sanctioning that might be required if
indiviudals were not trustworthy'" (53) -- cooperation and trust exist
independently

- cooperation between two parties can exist without requiring interpersonal
  trust "but becomes increasingly important as relationships persist"
    - DOES TIME == TRUST?
    - "cooperation over time leads to larger, higher-risk entrustments" (53) A
      BAD ACTOR COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS?

### ASSURANCE

- organizational/institutional mechanisms exist to protect individuals ->
  individuals rely on third-party protections instead of building mutual trust
-> trust paradox

**assurance** - designed to make interpersonal trust possible in uncertain
environments; effective systems minimize or eliminate one or more forms of
uncertainty leading to the source of uncertainty shifting to the assurance
system
- "Assurances lessen uncertainties, while trust thrives where uncertainties are
  abundant" (54)

"Individuals have a strong incentive to act cooperatively when robust
  monitoring and assurance structures are present, but cooperation in these
cases has more to do with sanctions and other negative outcomes than
interpersonal trust" (54)
    - WHAT JOSH SAID LAST WEEK ABOUT USERS VS BAD TO CORPORATIONS -- REGULATION
      HAS THE LATTER AFFECT HERE TOO

"strong forms of online security and assurance can supplant, rather than
enhance, trust" (54) 

**strong assurance systems** - e.g. third party verification systems, trust
anchors (authoritative body that provides assurances about data authenticity
between Internet networks)

- ASSURANCE SHIFTS TRUSTWORTHINESS CHECK FROM OTHER PARTY TO INTERMEDIARY LINK
  (SYSTEM OR COMPANY) WHICH IS MISGUIDED BECUASE THE USER IS DOES NOT ALWAYS
TAKE THE SAME PRECAUTIONS WITH THE SYSTEM AS THEY WOULD ANOTHER PARTY
- "As individuals learn to rely on assurance structures, they do so at the
  expense of interpersonal trust. The key implication is that if assurances
fail, cooperation and trust will fail as well" (54) I DON'T THINK WE CAN REPLACE
TRUST WITH ASSURANCE (LIKE WE CANNOT REPLACE HUMANS WITH COMPUTERS)

"Replacing human interpersonal relationships with authoritative trust anchors
would provide a centralized point of decision-making, but also of potential
failure" (54)

### SYSTEM TRUST

- "Trust in an information system primarily involves individuals' expectaions
  about whether the system will operate in a predictable manner and provide
reliable outputs" (55)
- "Information systems and computer programs appear to lack the agency and
  consciousness to choose freely to betray the trust that users place in them"
(55) THESE SYSTEMS ARE AN ABSTRACTED VERSION OF THEIR DEVELOPER/PROGRAMMER'S
POINT OF VIEW
- "the interaction lacks the relational dynamic that is essential to
  interpersonal trust" (55)
- "people tend to treat bots and information agents as if they are human, even
  when we clearly know they are not" (55) LOTS OF RESEARCH ON HOW HUMANS RESPOND
TO ROBOTS!

"When a system "betrays" a human's trust, assigning blam can have enormous
repercussions: should we blame the system itself, those who programmed the
system, the organization that hosts the system, a quality control person, the
director of the organization, or the organization in general?"
    - CSCI493: THE CASE OF THE KILLER ROBOT
    - MY ANSWER WAS THAT WE SHOULD BLAME EVERYONE BUT NOW THAT I THINK MORE
      ABOUT IT I DON'T THINK THAT IS FEASIBLE
    - ABSTRACTION FROM ABOVE: IT IS REALLY THE ABSTRACTION OF SEVERAL ENTITIES
      THAT FORM THE SYSTEM
    - IT'S A LOT EASIER TO PUSH BLAME AROUND WITH THIS MANY ACTORS

- system trust in governments and other organizational machinations:
  "individuals trust the structures of human interaction and organization" (56)
    - "trust placed in information systems often has less to do with the actual
      systems and more to do with the humans, organizations, and governments
that maintain or control them" (56) * THIS IS IMPORTANT

### DISCUSSION

"the possibilities and limitations of trust and social interaction on the
internet will depend entirely on how we design online communication technologies
in the context of the surrounding global political and institutional
environment" (57)
    - facilitate interpersonal interaction and embrace the complexity of
      emergent social uses of online information technologies?
    - build structures of control, limit and secure online social interactions
      and accept potential trade-offs for trust in exchange for assurance? NO,
THESE STRUCTURES ARE BASED ON THE MOTIVATIONS OF THE FEW BIG FISH RATHER THAN
THE COLLECTIVE, I THINK WE NEED TO PROMOTE MORE OF THE FORMER

"there is no real way to build meaningful trust without overcoming real risk in
the presence of uncertainty" (57)
- Assurance "encourage[s] cooperative behavior - especially when all other
  options fail" 

- centralized assurance structures -> less trusting Internet environment in the
  long term

I THINK PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF HOW WE GAIN TRUST
VIRTUALLY, WE CANNOT SHIFT RELIANCE TO SYSTEMS DESIGNED BY PEOPLE
