# Collective Information Practice
- privaxy and security "as embedded in social and cultural contexts ...
  holisitic view of situated and collective information practice"

### INTRODUCTION
"...easier ... to store everything on the off-chance that one day it will be
  needed. Knowing that any digital information we generate will likely be stored
and indexed transforms how we communicate and present ourselves" (320)
    - ORALITY AND LITERACY
    - change in our brains because we don't have to remember as much
    - CAN WE ACTUALLY STORE IT ALL? WHAT'S THE LIMIT? HOW DO WE CHOOSE?


**ubiquitous computing** - emphasis on caputuring aspects of personal and
  collective 'context'
    - operating in a pervasive sensing environment

### COLLECTIVE INFORMATION PRACTICE IN DESIGN
**information practice** - ways in which we collectively share, withhold, and
manage information; how we interpret such acts of sharing, withholding, and
managing

- "we see specific configurations of practice not as targets for design but as
  the outcome of processes and mechanisms whereby collective practice is
developed, shared, sustained, and transformed" (335)
- social products rather than natural facts

1. visualizing system activity: "gives users a means of understanding and
assessing the consequences of their action"
- "configuration and action can be achieved together" -- HOW DO WE AVOID
  OVERWHELMING A USER WITH BUTTONS?
- 

### CONCLUSION
- "usability cannot be an afterthought in the design of an interactive system"
  (337)
- "support for effective privacy protection cannot be grafted on to a system
  because it is a pervasive aspect of how that system is designed" (337)
- "Privacy is not a concept that can be separated from the collective practices
  through which it is achieved and made operable or from the other elements that
are achieved through those same practices" (338)
