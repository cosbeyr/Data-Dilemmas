# The Ethnography of Infrastructure

**infrastructure** - relational (connections) and ecological (physical/human
surroundings); part of the balance of action,
tools and built environment, inseparable from them 
    - THIS REMINDS ME OF HOW ETHNOGRAPHY WAS DESCRIBED (INSEPARABLE)
- "singularly unexciting" -- lists of numbers and technical specifications; indirect readings can be instructive; built into the fabric of technical work
- system of substrates: "turn on the faucet for a drink of water and you use a
  vast infrastructure of plumbing and water regulation without usually thinking
much about it"
    - WE SEE INFRASTRUCTURE BEST WHEN IT BREAKS DOWN
- Part of human organization

**ethnography**
- implicitly involves the study of infrastructure
- used to understand the details of work practice, extensive prototyping and
  user feedback
- "there have always been inherent scale limits on ethnography"
    - labor-intensive, analysis-intensive craft of qualitative research,
      combined with historical emphasis on single investigator studies
    - RELATED TO ETHNOGRAPHY READING -- HOW DO THESE ACCOUTNS FIT TOGETHER
- "capable of surfacing silenced voices, judging disparate meanings, and
  understanding the gap between words and deeds"
    - THE DREADED GAP??
- "Ethnographers trained to understand viewpoints, the definition of the
  situation"

## General Methodological Problems

- "There are much fewer [good studies] on the effect of standardization or
  formal classification on group formation, the design of networks and their
import for various communities ..."
    - these stretch our understanding of identity, status and community
- There is a need for methods of understanding imbrication of infrastructure and
  human organization
- "plugs" "settings" "sizes" -> mundane aspects of cyberspace (WHAT ARE THESE?)

### Properties of Infrastructure
- Located inside other structures
- Invisible - only visible when infrastructure breaks
- Globally-scoped
- Fixed incrementally "big, layered, and complex, ... means different things
  locally, it is never changed from above ... Changes take time and negotiation"

---

### Infrastructure And Methods
- Scalability? Groups are distributed geographically and temporally, involve
  hundreds of people or terminals

---

## Tricks of the Trade

### Identifying Master Narratives and "Others"

- e.g. "flesh-colored" bandages (closest to the color of White people's skin)
- "Listening for the master narrative and identifying it sa such means
  identifying first with that which has been made other, or unnamed"

### Surfacing Invisible Work

- "requires looking for these processes in the traces left behind by coders,
  designers, and users of systems"
    - ETHNOGRAPHY ARTICLE: POINTED OUT IMPORTANCE OF USERS
- "balance someone in the middle, making their work just visible enough for
  legitimation, but maintaining an area of discretion"
    - WHY DO WE NEED THE DISCRETION?

### Paradoxes of Infrastructure

- slight impediments have become magnified in the flow of the work process
- Two processes of work are occurring simultaneously
    - One is visible to the traditional analysis of user-with-system;
      keystroks/functionality
    - Other is process of assemblage, delicate/complex weaving of desktop
      resources, organizational routines, manner of articulation work performed
      invisibly by the user
- Production + articulation = good analysis of why some systems work

## The Thorny Problem of Indicators
- Information infrastructures:
    - *artifact* - constructed by people, physical/pragmatic properties, impact
    - *trace/record* - information and status are more important
    - *veridical representation* - mirror of actions in the world
        - THIS IS WHAT THE ETHNO PAPER SAID ETHNOGRAPHY WAS NOT

---

## Bridges and Barriers
- Question of whether and how values are inscribed into technical systems has
  been a live one in communities studying tech and its design
- e.g. low bridges == no buses == no poor people in rich suburb
    - design, rather than policy, affected this change
- "In information infrastructure, every conceivable form of variation in
  practice, culture, and norm is inscribed at the deepest levels of design"
    - THIS IS IMPORTANT
- "The effort to date has linked historians, sociologists, antropologists,
  philosophers, literary theorists, and computer scientists"
