# Implications for Design

1. Ethnography is incorrectly viewed as instrumental


**ethnography** - 
- HCI: emphasis on social organization of activity; democracy around
  computerization changes in workplace
- Anth: need to understand member's point of view; understand what members
  of a culture *experienced* through their actions
- Soc: American urban life, distance between subject and object through inquiry
  into subcultures/"outsider" groups/odd locations


**implications for design** - "this paper does not seem to be addressed towards
the CHI audience"
- WHO IS THE CHI AUDIENCE? WHO SHOULD THE CHI AUDIENCE BE?
- involves reading of ethnography as purely methodological, "to be selectively
  deployed as needed"
- 

---
**what it isn't**
- too often viewed as *purely methodological or instrumental*
- ethnography is not a passive agent
- ethnographic data is not unproblematically extracted from a setting and the
  ethnographer


**what is is**
- makes conceptual claims; theorizes subjects 
    - how members' experiences can be understood w.r.t. interplay between
      members and ethnographers
- about the cultural perspective from which it is written and that of the
  audience to whom is it presented
    - ethnographer tells as story about the collective self
- require that an ethnographer incorporate the context of the social
  relationship between ethnographer and subject/setting
- always, inherently a perspectival view
