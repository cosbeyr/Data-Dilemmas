# Implications for Design

1. Ethnography is incorrectly viewed as instrumental
2. Ethnography is incorrectly used in HCI as a "tool" rather than a means for analysis
3. 

**ethnography** - value: provides models and ways of thinking 
  computerization changes in workplace
- Anth: need to understand member's point of view; understand what members
  of a culture *experienced* through their actions
    - modern: conscious of and reflective about power dynamics and the nature of
      engagement with those being studied
- Soc: American urban life, distance between subject and object through inquiry
- HCI: emphasis on social organization of activity; democracy around
  into subcultures/"outsider" groups/odd locations


**implications for design** - "this paper does not seem to be addressed towards
the CHI audience"
- WHO IS THE CHI AUDIENCE? WHO SHOULD THE CHI AUDIENCE BE?
- involves reading of ethnography as purely methodological, "to be selectively
  deployed as needed"
- Assumptions:
    - Who is doing the design in these scenarios? ethnographers, technologists,
      people themselves (I ASSUME THEY MEAN USERS)
    - What does design look like? technology itself, form of its local
      adaptations and appropriations in social/cultural contexts
    - Are we doing justice to the ethnographic perspective? Are we getting the
      best tech outcomes? 
- request for empiricism/facts, QUANTITATIVE DATA COLLECTION

**what it isn't**
- too often viewed as *purely methodological or instrumental*
- ethnography is not a passive agent
- ethnographic data is not unproblematically extracted from a setting and the
  ethnographer
- a discipline in service to another (like CS is to other fields)
    - WHY CAN'T WE USE IT THIS WAY? WHAT MAKES IT SO SPECIAL?
- "ethnography is not ... necessarily best oriented towards the creation of new
  sorts of technological or consumer artifacts" * THIS IS IMPORTANT
    - analysis of culture and social organization of some particular setting or
        occassion is often best articulated independently of the specific systems,
        technologies or design briefs
    - IS IT MORE ABOUT HOW THE TECH, PEOPLE, ETC FIT TOGETHER IN THE BIGGER
      PICTURE?
- ethnography cannot be a mediator between social and tech

**what is is**
- makes conceptual claims; theorizes subjects 
    - how members' experiences can be understood w.r.t. interplay between
      members and ethnographers
- about the cultural perspective from which it is written and that of the
  audience to whom is it presented
    - ethnographer tells as story about the collective self
- require that an ethnographer incorporate the context of the social
  relationship between ethnographer and subject/setting
- always, inherently a perspectival view
- may recommend what should *not* be built rather than what should
- understanding sociotechnical rather than fixing
- gives form and meaning to tech; focus is the ways in which practice brings
  technology into being
- refigure "users" not as passive recipients but as actors who collectively
  create the circumstances, contexts and consequences of tech use
    - how technologists take on specific social meanings through their embedding
      within systems of practice
- imagination rather than toolbox: requires sensitivity for the nature of the
  interaction between ethnographers and their subjects and the representations
  of culture and practices

### Power Relations

- power differential between engineering sciences and social sciences
- relationship contstrued by the idea that the goal of ethnography is to
  generate implications for design
- Three issues:
    - Designers viewed as gatekeepers for research
    - Places ethnography outside of the design process itself
    - Places ethnographers outside of the design process
- incorrect view: suggestion that ethnographic investigations are relevant only
  in as much as they support design

---

### Technology and Practice

* ASSUMPTION 1: Constructs ethnography as a point of mediation between a domain
  of everyday practices and a domain of technological design
    * these domains cannot be separated; mutually constitutive
* ASSUMPTION 2: Implies that people will encounter technology as something that
  is encountered just as it was designed

- "[creative processes] are seen as natural consequences of everyday action, not
  as a problem to be eliminated" THIS IS IMPORTANT
    - technology = site for social and cultural production
- closing the "sociotechnical gap" doesn't make sense: the gap is where
  interesting stuff happens (a natural consequence of human experience)

---

### Moments and Models

- moments - descriptive, historical acounts; "here's what happened"
- alternative: models for understanding social settings
    - important: explanatory frame by which this account can be organized
    - important: explanatory frame that is the narrative that connects "moments"
    - THIS MAKES SENSE TO ME, WE CANNOT UNDERSTAND BIG PICTURE BY LOOKING AT ONE
      CORNER OF IT

---

### What's To Be Done

- ethnographic contributions should not be evaluated by their "implications for
  design"
- what matters is *why*, and how they were arrived at and what kinds of
  intellectual commitments they embody and what models they reflect
- Two levels of contribution:
    - analytic: comprise the ways in which these data are theorized, understood,
      organized, interpreted and presented (observations == theory-laden) 
    - empirical: comprise fundamental observational material, "this is what
      happens"

* Analytical are important; provide us with new ways of imagining the
    relationship between people and tech; new ways of approaching design

1. Question the concept of the ethnographic site; "multi-sited ethnography"
    - subject must be understood within the context of globalization
    - GLOBAL AND LOCAL -- HOW DO WE ACCOUNT FOR BOTH
    - transnational flow of people, capital and culture
    - BRINGS ME BACK TO IDEA THAT WE CANNOT CONSIDER TECH INDIVIDUALLY


---

### Implications for Design

- cultural probes - means to conduct broad-based surveys of user experience;
  self-reported packages of artifacts, questionnaires and exercises that
encourage users to reflect on their experience
    - data intended to provide inspiration rather than basis for analysis   
    - similar to ethnography? no, lack coupling of analytic and methodological,
      locate topics of interest outside of relationship between ethnographer and
subject

* "Ethnography has a critical role to play in interactive system design, but
this many be as much in shaping research (or corporate) strategy as in
uncovering the constraints or opportunities faced in a particular design
exercise"
