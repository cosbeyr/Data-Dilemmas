# Body, Biometrics and Identity
- "Who are we, if we are not our body? And what is our body without us?" (488)
- "identification is not a trivial fact but always involves a web of economic
  interests, political relations, symbolic networks, narratives and meanings"
(488)
- "Biometric identification technologies are a special case of Auto-ID because
  they associate identities to individuals by using measurable personal
features instead of something owned or known by the individual" (488)

**digital biometrics** - digit format allows us to collect, store and process
electronically a huge amount of data in a short period of time; numeric strings;
"automatic biometric technologies for personal recognition" (489)
- fingerprints, ultrasound fingerprinting, iris scans, hand geometry, facial
  recognition, ear shape, signature dynamics, voice recognition, computer
keystroke dynamics, skin patterns, foot dynamics
- neural wave analysis, skin luminescence, remote iris scan, advanced facial
  recognition, body odour

**multimodal systems** - match different identification technologies

**multiple biometrics** - consist of different types of biometrics used in
combination

**behavioral biometrics** - measure behavioral characteristics such as
signature, voice, keystroke pattern and gait

"A sharp debate is emerging about whether biometric technology offers society
any significant advantages over other forms of personal identification, and
whether it constitutes a threat to privacy and a potential weapon in the hands
of authoritarian governments" (289)


### Function Creep
**function creep** - "term used to describe the expansion of a process or system, where data
collected for one specific purpose is subsequently used for another unintended
or unauthorized purpose" (490)
- CORONAVIRUS DATA COLLECTION
- "has the potential to erode public trust and destroy confidence in a given
  system" (490)

**policy vacuum** - when organizations ... adopt new information technologies
... while failing to create specific policies these technologies ... driven only
by different interests of various stakeholders (490)

**unsatisfied demand** - information collected for one purpose is used for
another when there is a need that is not properly met (490)

**slippery slope effect** - either the new function(s) develop litle by litle
... or the new functions are the result of a hidden agenda

"The principle of data minimization, or limitation, should then be the
cornerstone of any biometric policy that is respectful of privacy and ethical
tenets" (491).


### Biometric Systems are Redundant
**shadow information** - "any system for facial recognition inescapably ends up
collecting extra information on people's age, gender and ethnicity... have the
potential to detect people's emotional states, as reflected in their expressions" (491)

"Although most current technologies have no capability for determining the
causes of recognition failure, no one can exclude the possibility that future
applications may be designed to identify these causes" (491)
- I'M AN ADVOCATE OF MODEL INTERPRETABILITY - IS THIS AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE
  OF TRANSPARENCY IN THE WRONG HANDS?

"As a consequence, biometric characteristics could become a covert source for
prospective medical information, allowing people to be profiled according to
their current and potential health status" (491-492)
- POTENTIAL FOR INCREASED DISCRIMINATION THAT PROFITS BIG COMPANIES
- "people should be always aware of the presence of biometric sensors. This is a
  very difficult goal not only because some
  applications are by definition covert (e.g. screening and surveillance), but
also because biometric sensors are more and more embedded in ambient
intelligence environments" (492)

"in almost any working phase biometric systems might generate extra information,
which has the potential to be further used for unintended, unauthorized,
purposes" (493) 
- NOT TO MENTION USED TO IDENTIFY OTHER PEOPLE BECAUSE NETWORKED DATA (DANA
  BOYD)


### Why Biometric Systems Cannot Avoid Being Redundant
"Communication always introduce a distinction, which is already a form of
identification" (493)

**personal recognition** - "involves conscious, explicit, messages, which are
usually conveyed by verbal languages, and unconscious, implicit, messages that
are mostly channeled by non-verbal (bodily) languages" (493)
- "nonverbal languages also convey information on culture, ethnicity, and age,
  social groups to which the individual belongs and in which she grew up" (493)
THIS IS DEBATABLE, CANNOT GLEAN ANY OF THIS JUST BY LOOKING AT A PERSON, LOTS OF
FALSE POSITIVES
- MOST OF OUR NONVERBAL ASSUMPTIONS ARE JUST THAT: ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON OUR OWN
  HISTORY AND EXPERIENCES, NOT RELATED TO THE PERSON WE ARE JUDGING DIRECTLY
- THERE AREN'T ANY GOOD SYSTEMS, TECHNOLOGICAL OR NOT, TO CLASSIFY PEOPLE IN THE
  WAYS DEFINED BY "PERSONAL RECOGNITION" - THIS IS A FAKE CONCEPT

"Biometrics allow people to be recognized by using their physical appearances
and behaviors and, in doing this, biometrics exploit the vast web of messages
that the human body continuosly produces" (493)
- REMINDS ME OF THE SENTIMENTS IN THE APARTHEID READING
- FOCUS ON 'VISUAL' -- IN THIS CASE A DEEPER VISUAL REPRESENTATION BUT
  NONETHELESS VISUAL
- NO INPUT FROM BRAIN OR HOW THE PERSON IN QUESTION INTERPRETS THEIR
  EXISTENCE/EXPERIENCES


### Informatization of the Body
**informatization** - the digitalization of physical and behavioral attributes
of a person and their distribution across the global information network
- "concern for the ways in which digitalization of physical features may affect
  the representation of ourselves and may produce processes of 'disembodiment'
(494)
- HOW APARTHEID LEAD TO PASSING AND LOSING OF ONE'S CULTURE/FAMILY
- "human essence" WE ARE MORE THAN OUR PHYSICALITY, I'M NOT CONVINCED WE COULD
  EVERY FULLY REPRESENT A HUMAN WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY


"biometrics aims to turn persons into mere living objects, which can be measured
and matched with similar living objects" (494)
- "regulating large numbers of people" UTILITY/CONVENIENCE OVER MORALITY/ETHICS
- dehumanization
- "biometricvs appear as a key technology in a contemporary redefinition of the
  body in terms of information" (495)


### Could Biometric Increase Human Freedom
- "One can claim her rights, included the right to be left alone, and the right
  to refuse to be identified, only if she is an identifiable subject, if she has
a public identity" (495-496)
- BACKWORDS: REFUSING TO BE IDENTIFIED LIMITS OTHERS ABILITY TO GIVE ME A PUBLIC
  IDENTITY
- WHY CAN'T I HAVE ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER?
- PROBLEM WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF OUR SOCIETY: EXAMPLE OF INVISIBLE GIRL (NO
  IDENTIFICATION, LIMITED FREEDOM IN OUR SOCIETY)
- FEEDS INTO SECURITY, YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO BE RECONIZED IN ORDER TO HAVE
  CONTROL OVER WHO CAN RECOGNIZE YOU

"Biometric technologies also promise to liberate citizens from the 'tyranny' of
nation states and create a new global, decentralized, rhyzomatic schemes for
personal recognition" (496)
- IS GLOBAL REPRESENTATION POSSIBLE? ARE CATEGORIES INHERENT TO THIS SCHEME? IF
  SO, THAT PROBABLY WON'T WORK

"Biometric systems are the only large-scale identification systems that could
also be run by small private actors and independent agencies instead of heavy
governmental structures" (497)
