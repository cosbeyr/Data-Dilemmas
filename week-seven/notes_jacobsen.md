# Experimentation in humanitarian locations
- risks: technology failure, successful uses of biometric technology
- fingerprinting and iris recognition in humanitarian contexts
    - refugee registraction

### Historical Context
- **biopolitics**: discrimination and categorization; "place[s] biometrics in
  relation to a broader phenomenon of 'data managing and arithmetizing the
other' (146)
- ROOTS IN SEGREGATION?

### Theorizing technology as constituted and constiutive
- **constitutive agency** - "not only to be located in human actors whose will
  or intention may be sought/realized through otherwise passibe technology" (146)
- "the emergence of technology as sources of new kinds of scientific knowledge
  influences the constitution of political interests so much so that they ...
underwrite each other's existence" (146)
- "helps us to recognize how different risks may transpire at these two levels
  (constitution by technology and constiution of technology), thereby enabling
an appreciation of the potential risks that cannot be understood simply as the
consequence of technology failures" (147)


### Emergence of social order and social identity

#### When technology loops back: social order
- "the significance of this emergence of digalized biometric refugee templace is
  inseparable from, and influences, the crystallization of policatl interests in
the creation of 'globalised interoperable databases', which in turn could be
said to have implications for how this digitalized refugee subject is governed" (156)

#### When technology loops back: social identites and categories
- function creep: "tendency for a project to exceed its original purpose ... can
  place participants in unforeseen or difficult circumstances" (156)
- specific type: "the expansion of scope to include cross-matching against
  templates in other databases" (156)
- HOW DO WE HOLD AN ORGANIZATION COLLECTING DATA ACCOUNTABLE? 
- "UNHCR operates in a complex legal landscape that, in some cases, implies an
  absence of clearly defined data-protection frameworks" (156)
- HOW DO ORGANIZATIONS WITH DIFFERENT LAWS/RESTRICTIONS/FRAMEWORKS COEXIST? IF
  WE INTRODUCE REGULATION UNDER ONE JURISDICTION, HOW DOES THAT PLAY INTO
ANOTHER?

#### Privacy and the digital refugee:
- "if it should happen that actors with motives other than refugee protection
  gained access to this refugee database" (158)
- "Even though the data were anonymized, the person's identity could be
  determined by an external actor if it matched (or was believed to match) an
iris template in another database" (158)
- THIS WAS OVERLOOKED IN THE LAST ARTICLE
- POINTS TO A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING ABOUT HOW CONNECTED SOURCES OF DATA CAN
  ACTUALLY BE (REDUNDANCY)


### Concluding remarks
- "it would seem advisable to revisit underlying assumptions about what
  technology is and does, and subsequently to reflect cautiously on the
potential risks that the introduction of biometrics may entail for the
implicated refugee population" (159)
