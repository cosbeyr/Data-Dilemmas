# The Case of Race Classification and Reclassification under Apartheid

**texture of classification** - "composed of thick filiations, encompassing much of
  a person's life, imposed from the outside, and filled with uncertanty and
contradiction" (195)

### Background

"each race must develop separately along its natural pathway, and that race
mingling was unnatural" (197)
- AGAINST POOLING RESOURCES TO BETTER THE COMMUNITY
- REDEFINING OF "COMMUNITY" - BASED ON RACE RATHER THAN LOCATION OR SHARED INTERESTS
- "These sexual borders were vigorously patrolled by police ... detailed use of
  binoculars, tape recorders, cameras, and two-way radios to trap offenders" (197)
- A FORM OF GOVERNMENT CONTROL
- WHY ARE WHITE POLICE OFFICERS ABLE TO POLICE BLACK PEOPLE? IF THE PHILOSOPHY
  IS AROUND EACH RACE DEVELOPING SEPARATELY HOW CAN A WHITE PERSON DECIDE WHAT A
BLACK PERSON SHOULD OR SHOULDN'T DO?

"For apartheid to function at this level of detail, people had to be
unambiguously categorizable by race ... Many people did not conform to the
typologies constructed under the law" (201)
- THESE TYPOLOGIES WERE WHATEVER BEST HELPED THOSE IN POWER
- "Any attempt at race classification and therefore of race definition can at
  best be only an approximation" (203)
- "...the burden of proof would fall on disproving the non-European side" (203) 


### Conflicting Categories in South Africa
- Groups carry varying levels of privilege - this affects children
- "The barriers to movement to a less privileged class were of course more
  permeable that those to passing 'up'" (204)
- "the formal-informal mixture itself produces organizational conditions that
  favored both structural and face-to-face ad hoc discrimination, the one
reinforcing the other ... biases become deeply embedded in both practice and
infrastructure" (204)
- THOSE IN POWER BENEFITTING FROM INCONSISTENT TERMINOLOGY
- DOES THE INVISIBLE NATURE OF INFRASTRUCTURE PROMOTE THIS BEHAVIOR?
- THOSE IN POWER HELP THE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY THAT LOOK LIKE THEM OR SHARE THEIR
  IDEOLOGY - WE SEE THIS THROUGHOUT HISTORY


### The South African Coloured Population and Reclassification
- "The reclassification process was fraught in myriad ways and was completely
  internally inconsistent" (208)
- INCONSISTENCY: A COMMON THEME CONSTRIBUTING TO RACISM
- "administering a range of tests of race" 
- PASSING: Sula, Boy Snow Bird
- "The network of suspicion, spying, and search for purity implied here affected
  every aspect of South African life for those in all racial categories" (209)
- * SURVEILLANCE - STILL RELEVANT TODAY


### Technologies of Classifying
- "Because of the ambiguous nature of both the notion of general appearance and
  of general acceptance, the burden of evidence fell on the person desiring to
be reclassified" (213)
- ALL BASED ON VISUALS / ACTIVITIES / ASSSUMPTION OF DIFFERENCES / PSEUDOSCIENCE

### Passing
- THESE "CLASSIFICATIONS," HOWEVER INCORRECT TO BEGIN WITH, MANIFESTED IN THE
  COMMUNITY - THOSE THAT COULD PASS AS WHITE SEPARATED THEMSELVES FROM RELATIVES
AND FRIENDS THAT COULD NOT PASS
- "One school psychologist held the belief that the school ratings were lowered
  by coloured children as they performed more poorly on IQ tests" IQ TESTS
DESIGNED FOR WHITE CHILDREN
- "this establishes a track record that can be used as leverage for
  reclassification based on general acceptance and repute" (216)
- GIVING UP HERITAGE, CULTURE AND FRIENDSHIPS IN ORDER TO HAVE PRIVILEGES SOME
  MIGHT EQUATE TO BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS


### Reclassifcation and Borderlands
- "Lize, more than any other person, represented the moment when the gaps
  created by the enforced mingling of prototype and Aristotelian category are
laid bare, and the absurdities of aprtheid law made clear" (217)


### Language and Race as Conflicting Categories
- "The idea of a separate development required that black people fit into mythic
  categories of pure tribal groups" (218) OVERSIMPLIFICATION OF HUMANS AND HUMAN
LIFE - THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE TO FIT A SATISFYING "NARRATIVE" EVEN IF THAT
NARRATIVE IS DEFINED BY SOMEONE ELSE
- "There was no room for people or circumstances that did not fit this image"
  (218) INCONVENIENCE
- WHAT ARE THE CRITERIA TO BE A MEMBER OF A COMMUNITY? HOW DO WE EVEN DEFINE
  "COMMUNITY"? HOW DOES THE INTERNET AND INTERNET COMMUNITIES FACTOR INTO THIS?


### Sudden Changes
- "Sandra's parents rejected the idea that this madeher coloured, however.
  Sandra's father stated that she had been brought up 'naturally' as a white
child" (220) 
- LESS ABOUT GENES AND MORE ABOUT HOW THEY WERE RAISED, NONSENSE
- EVERYTHING BASED ON HOW WE LOOK VISUALLY
- * CLASSIFICATION IS A FORM OF CONTROL
- WHITE PEOPLE DON'T SEE THE PRIVILEGE AND MISTREATMENT OF OTHERS UNTIL THEY ARE
  AFFECTED BY THE MISTREATEMENT
-"it constituted an object lesson in the problematics of classifying individuals
into life-determining boxes, outside of their control, tightly coupled with
their every movement and in an ecology of increasing densely classified
activities" (223)
- OUTSIDE OF THEIR CONTROL - HARD TO APPEAL THE CLASSIFICATION THAT HAS BEEN
  GIVEN TO YOU
- COUPLED WITH THEIR EVERY MOVEMENT - INCREASED SURVEILLANCE BY THOSE IN POWER
  IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN CONTROL
- OVERSIMPLIFICATION OF SOCIETY BENEFITING THOSE IN POWER/THOSE WITH
  PRIVILEGE/THOSE WILLING TO GIVE UP THEIR HERITAGE AND CULTURE AND "CONFORM" 


**strategic essentialism** - "Regardless of the scientific or genetic basis for
the category, they said, racism against people with any black African ancestry
was real, and the category was necessary to obtain resources and justice" (224)
- POINTS TO WAYS THOSE AFFECTED ADAPT AND THRIVE IN A PREJUDICED SYSTEM - WORRY
  THAT CHANGE WILL BE DETRIMENTAL


### Conclusion
- "[systems] are used to build up subtle (and not-so-subtle) profiles of
  individuals based on their filiations to a myriad of categories" (224)
