# Degrees of Freedom, Dimensions of Power

"Internet-design decisions will affect political, economic, institutional,
social, and cultural arrangements, and decisions that will influence the next
quarter-century are all being influenced themselves by sustained efforts of
diverse parties that stand to benefit from them"


- original Internet design: technical, organizational and cultural
  characteristics that decentralized power along diverse dimensions
- new tech: new control points and dimensions of power into the internet as a
  social-cultural-economic platform
- ARGUMENT: "If we are to preserve the democratic and creative promise of the
  Internet, we must continuously diagnose control points ... and devise
mechansisms of recreating diversity of constraint and degrees of freedom in the
network"

**Gnutella** - basis for a range of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks began by AOL,
"technical architecture, cultural practice, social production, market structure,
and timing prevented AOL from halting the development of Gnutell"

**Apple** - exerted power over users and developers (proprietary cellular
networks, OS integrated with hardware that controlled software, "app store"
model of software distribution
- proprietary, controlled devices, software


**cloud computing** - point of control; advertiser-supported platform
- enabled by increased speed of communications and widespread adoption of mobile
  computing == control point
- "individuals and businesses run their computation and storage clusters owned
  and managed by third-party providers ... allows firms to economize on capital
expenditures, enhance robustness and security, and scale computation, storage,
and applications more flexibly than provisioning their own capacity would
permit"
- centralizes power; "concern ... what third parties can do given the
  concentration of data and software in a single spot"
- "when the data and software of hundreds of millions of people exist or run in
  a single place, whoever can compromise and gain control over it - legitimately
or illegitimately - can exercise power over these hundreds of millions of
people" THIS IS IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT

**wireless telephony** - "fundamentally built to enable control by the owner and
service provider so as to optimize a known set of services to known paying
consumers"
- contrast to Internet model

**data caps but exclude favored services from counting against data caps**
-"nudge users to adopt the preferred applications" 
- "ownership of the spectrum and the service, the concept of optimization, and
  the integration of use with known paying users permit the company to exert
control over what users can do and what companies unaffiliated with the service
providers can offer"


**cable broadband and DSL of telephone lines** - "increased the complexity of
providing services and reduced the number of potential competitors" 
- significant point of control
- "slowdown occurred ... was likely caused by business disputes, not technical
  issues" THIS IS NOT GOOD


**Big Data** - allows a small number of companies to predict, shape and "nudge"
the behaviors of people
- "create extremely powerful insights on mass populations available to
  relatively few entities"
- "surveillance capitalism"
- "As consumers become more precisely and individually predictable in their
  behavioral response to experimentally derived stimuli, and platforms ever-more
programmable at an individual level to obtain desired behavioral responses, the
idea of individual "preferences" that are exogenous and preexist market
relations, ... becomes incoherent"
- PCAST report on big data: repudiated consent and anonymization
    - consent: non-level playing field
    - anonymization: easily defeated
    - recommendation: "accept the futility of regulating data collection and
      processing and implement more rigorous regulations on uses of collected
data" YES TO THIS 
    - shifted onus of protection to the legal system
    - "formalized rules imposed externally by a regulatory body are likely to
      function as imperfectly and incompletely as the technological or
contractual subsystems that PCAST rejected"
        - SO HOW DO WE COMBAT THIS? REGULATION IS A GOOD ANSWER IN SOME FORM

**Netflix effect** - content as culture; "shift in cultural power and erosion of
one of the core institutional and organizational mechanisms that made the
Internet a force for decentralization of social, economic, and cultural power"
- effort to impose power through technology: allow one entity to determine who
  may make what uses of digital objects protected by DRM
- "the shift to widespread passive consumption usage patterns weakens the role
  that FOSS development could play to provision a separate, power-diffusing
alternative infrastructure"
- "occurs alongside continued expansion of decentralized cultural creation and
  decentralized power, which can encourage ... inserting ... new frameworks into
cultural discourse" YOUTUBE PLAYS A BIG ROLE IN TRYING TO REVERSE THIS


*early Internet* 
- technical system
- innovative organizational system
- institutional system pervaded by commons
- competitive market with low barriers to entry
- a zeitgeist, cultural habit of mind/ideology
- "biased in favor of decentralization of power and freedom to act ... we
  benefited from an explosion of decentralized entrepreneurial activity and
expressive individual work, as well as extensive participatory activity"
    - also supported cybercrime, spam and malice
    - PROS AND CONS
- "unlike in the early days, everyone knows [that internet architecture shapes
  power] now" -> WHAT DID POWER LOOK LIKE IN THE EARLY INTERNET? WERE THERE
FEWER BIG, "BAD" FISH?
- integrated system of open systems (technical standards of the Internet and
  WWW, open organizational models of IETF and W3C, market of connectivity and
devices)
    - open, standards-based devices
    - commons-based production (free and open-source software)
    - cultural resistance to authority 
- "a system designed to resist the application of power from any centralized
  authority"

*now Internet*
- changes to early elements underwrite the transformation of the Internet
- a more effective platform for the reconcentration of power
- "these changes have destabilized the diverse open systems that had made up
  what we thought of as the Internet"
- greater centralization and stabilization of power
- "facilitates the accumulation of power by a relatively small set of
  influential state and nonstate actors"


**power** - capacity of an entity to alter the behaviors, beliefs, outcomes or
configurations of some other entity; shaped by internet architecture; "often
involves the capacity to reshape terms of engagement"
    - centralized: state or big company
    - decentralized: distributed among individuals or loose collectives


"If one were naive enough to imagine that all efforts at centralization were
aimed merely at taming the "bad" decentralization" -> HOW CAN WE FIX ONE WITHOUT
INTRODUCING THE OTHER?
    - "maintaining an Internet both open enough and resistent enough to power to
      allow, at least, continued contestation of decisions to create points of
control in the networked environments"


### DESIGN SUGGESTIONS
"To design a system that will disrupt forms of power - old and new - as they
emerge, and that will provide a range of degrees of freedom, allowing
individuals and groups to bob and weave among the sources and forms of power
that the Internet is coming to instantiate"

"The re-emergence of natural monopoly economics in home broadband leaves us with
a market or regulatory design choice"
- "Regulation in a number of forms seems most likely to diffuse power; this will
  likely require a combination of utility regulation ... and net neutrality
rules requiring nondiscrimination among applications and content"

"Consumption choices appear to severely constrain the freedom of action of
public-facing software development FOSS projects; interventions, if any, must be
at the level of shaping demand, on the model of ethical or environmentally
conscious consumption campaigns, rather than focusing solely on ethical design"
- WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

"design must take into account the resilience, redundancy, and diversity of
systems resources and pathways"
- must reject perfectibility and optimization for openness, loose-coupling, and
  continuous experimentation, learning and adapting
- "we need systems that are resilient, robust, and rich in redundant pathways
  that are open to users to achieve any given range of goals they adopt for
themselves"
- "design efforts need to resist calls for optimization and greater control by
  trusted parties if these come at the expense of open, redundant pathways and
resilient capabilities"



### INTERVENTIONS
1) User-owned and commons-based infrastructure

"individuals acting in peer networks can cooperate effectively without relying
on the state or the market. In doing so, they create their own ... alternative
platforms for interaction which .., impose different constraints"
- diversity of constraint = diffuses centralized power and creates avenues for
  decentralized power

"design technical and contractual systems that cna permit unrelated individuals
to share access to their diversely owned wireless spots"

"develop technically instantiated mechanisms to achieve user-owned and -shared
capacity that offers no proprietary point of control for centralizing actors"


2) distributed storage or computing

3) open defaults

4) strong, user-controlled encryption by default
    - user-controlled: provides affordances to the owner of the device on which
      the encryption is implemented and constrains action on that device by others
    - univeresal, strong: protects against centralizing and decentralized powers

5) robust audit system
    - "create mechanisms for assuring distributed audit and accountability,
      rather than permission"

6) user-owned and/or ethical governance in platforms
- "peer production and social self-organization offer a diverse and rich design
  space for solving collective action problems and implementing organizational
effectiveness without necessarily falling into the trap of state or market"
