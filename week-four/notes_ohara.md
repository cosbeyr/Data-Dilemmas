# Internet Tussels - a framework for analyzing heterogeneous networks

**internet tussles** - way of updating the end-to-end argument to account for
how values and conflict are mediated and built into the internet
    - an attempt to update the influential end-to-end argument; informed by user
      empowerment
    - how conflicting interests between two or more parties are mediated by the
      Internet
    - "argue for sociotechnical, somewhat self-reflective, perspective within
      the technical internet design community, one that intentionally looks to
adjacent fields to understand the nature of technology" (3)
    - AT : human and non-human actors, including digital technology, should be
      given equal attention as shapers of society
    - against the ideal that "values, such as privacy, can be achieved through
      technology alone" (3)
    - "regulated not just by technical mechanism but by mechanisms such as laws,
      judges, societal opinion, shared values"

**multi-tussle** - an analytic method developed for the analysis of qualitative
case studies

### Growth in internet use leads to internet tussels
- DARPA + NSF: funding priority of networked computing
- Internet protocols: developed and used in the context of universities and
  government research institutions
    - "the community involved in designing the internet was both small and
      comprised of colleagues who trusted one another" (O'Hara, 1)
- "making the network protocols nonspecialized would provide greater
  interpretative flexibility for future protocol and application design" (2)
    - AT WHAT COST?
- "openness" : "the end-to-end design of the internet ... meant it was open for
  [users] to build upon" (2)
- "user empowerment" : "a set of design preferences that bridged the technical
  end-to-end argument with an ideological notion of individual choice" (2)
- commercialization brought new stakeholders with diverse and conflicting
  interests
