# The Contingent Internet

**Internet** - modular and general; datagram network
- "general purpose" network designed for a variety of uses
- "a system that moves data, and the applications ... run on top of that
  data-transport service"
- contingent on key decisions of designers past and present
- email -> streaming audio/video -> streaming high quality video 
- "the past tells us that we should always be alert to protect the future even
  when faced with the needs of the present"

**datagram** - simpler core, more functions shifted to hosts at the edge

**virtual-circuit** - more function in the core of the net, more power and
control shifted to the network operator CENTRALIZED?

1) "users of the Internet are an active force in defining what the network is,
both by choice of application and by the creation of unexpected applications
never anticipated by network engineers" THIS IS IMPORTANT
    - USERS HAVE POWER IN THIS WAY 

2) "the open character of the Internet is what allows this sort of user-driven
evolution to take place"


- "The global community will need to decide the extent to which we fight against
  this diversification of the user experience"
    - diversification = eroding vision of "platform for global discourse and a
      vector for global civil society" DO WE NEED THIS?
    - "If the nations of the world were to push for some sort of global
      alignment of regulation and incentive, it would likely lead to a more
homogenous but less satisfactory Internet experience"
    - "the ideal is an Internet that accepts the diversity of experience for
      most users, but permits interaction on a global level among users who seek it"
- "the original design of the Internet did not include any mechanisms to deal
  with identity management"
    - "defining which actors can issue globally trustworthy identity credentials
      is, of course, another challenge to uniform identity management"
- "a generation of users will equate the Internet not with sending email, not
  with searching the Web, but with using Facebook"

* "there might be a richer, more diverse set of uses for the internet if
nonprofit actors were motivated and supported to develop "non-commercial"
applications" WHO WOULD SUPPORT THIS? THE MONEY COMES PRIMARILY FROM CORPORATE
* "interested parties to vote with their dollars, funding the development of
applications that are not motivated by the pursuit of profits, but by interest
in civic, cultural, or political participation"
    * HOW DOES THIS RELATE TO ASKING USERS TO PAY FOR THE INTERNET?
* "how the voice of the users of the world can be injected into the decisions
that will shape the future of the Internet"

### CONSEQUENCES OF GENERALITY
- "open" Internet: applications that run over the basic transport service of the
  Internet are not designed or distributed by the same entity that provides the
basic data-transport service
- "net neutrality" - whether broadband providers should be regulated to provide
  a neutral, open platform for third-party services or if they have the right to
define services they offer over infrastructre they invested in building
- "data-transport layer of the Internet has no concept of what the application
  is trying to do"
- core requirements (like security) are divided among several actors
    - "the design decisions that shaped the Internet ... likely did not optimize
      secure and trustworthy operation"


### ENCRYPTION
- promotes privacy of communication among communities of users
- thwarts the goals of the intelligence community (spying) and Internet service
  providers (prevents them from seeing what their users are doing, "optimize
their experience") -> REMINDS ME OF FB'S PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES
- "The tussle over the use of encrpytion is only the latest chapter in the
  struggle between the providers of the data-transport service of the Internet,
the providers of higher-level services and applications, the users, and the
state system for control of the user experience"


### STRUGGLES FOR CONTROL
- "tussels between ISPs, application designers, device makers, and governments"
- "The immense power of private-sector actors is notable; society has largely
  left the future of the Internet in the hands of far-reaching, profit-seeking
entities"
    - "recurring tension between building an application that attracts users and
      developing an application that makes money ... Competition cannot
discipline this behavior if the behavior alone allows commercial providers of
applications to make money"

* Two sources of money to pay for the Internet:
    * fees we pay as service subscribers (broadband access, applications/services)
    * advertising ("free" Internet experience)
* New source: "users pay a small amount for access to a broad spectrum of
Internet applications that do not track their usage and do not run on ad"
    * THIS IS IMPORTANT BUT I DOUBT THE PUBLIC WOULD BE RECEPTIVE
