# Obstacles to the Adoption of Secure Communication Tools
- interviewed sixty participants about their experience with different
  communication tools and their perceptions of the tools' security properties
- adoption hindered by "fragmented user bases" and "incompatible tools"
- "their personal data is also subject to commercial analysis by service
  providers for advertising and enhanced personalization"
    - WHO SHOULD BE ADVOCATING? WHAT IS THE ADVOCATES ROLE IN RELATION TO THE AD
      COMPANIES, GOVERNMENTS AND THE END USERS?
- "... designed to hide security from the user completely (albeit at some
  security cost)" (1)

"We argue that to design and build communication tools that effectively protect
users, we need to understand how users perceive secure communications, and what
influences their decision to adopt (or not adopt) secure tools" (1)
- FROM THE OTHER ARTICLE, SECURITY IS TYPICALLY A SECONDARY GOAL
- "Many participants ranked the services (e.g., voice calls, messages) offered
  by the tools, rather than the tools first" (2)
- "Our findings suggest not only a gap between users' understanding of secure
  tools and the technical reality, but also a gap between users' communication
priorities and what the security research community imagines them to be" THIS IS
BAD - IT IS THE SECURITY RESEARCH COMMUNITIES JOB TO UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF THE
USERS

**trust establishment** - providing assurance that a user is truly communicating
with the intended party (main UI challenge for E2E)

## Methodology

### Research Questions
- Why, when, how users use secure communications
- What threats users want to protect against 
- Which communication tools users perceive to be secure and why
- How users think secure communications can be achieved and how it can be
  breached

### Participants
- "users of communication tools who do not consider themselves to be at risk of
  targeted surveillance" (5) THE LOWEST RUNG OF THE LADDER
- they have less motivation to use these tools

### Interviews
- Adoption of communication tools
- User-defined secure communication
- Security ranking
- Security properties and mechanisms

## Results

## Discussion
- "to be adopted, secure tools have to offer their intended users utility; i.e.,
  the ability to reach their communication partners" (14)
- "using different tools was perceived as an overhead they were not willing to
  carry for security" (14) THIS WILL CHANGE WITH FUTURE GENERATIONS?
- "they did not believe the tools available are actually secure" (14)
- main takeaway: "non-experts do not understand abstract security properties"
- "We need to make users understand that it is in their power to protect
  themselves because several security mechanisms have been developed based on
the best available knowledge from security research" (15)

"the EFF is redesigning the scorecard to group tools into general tiers from
'most secure' to 'insecure'" (15)
- "While not necessarily related to security and privacy, these items drive
  adoption and would be recommended to include them in the scorecard" (15)
    - PRIMARY USE! THAT'S WHAT THE USERS CARE ABOUT
HOW DO WE CHANGE MENTAL MODELS?
