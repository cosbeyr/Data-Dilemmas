# Collecting Digital Content at the Library of Congress (2017)

### Vision
"The adopted strategy is based on a vision in which the Library's universal collection will continue to be built by selectively acquiring materials in a wide range of formats - both tangible and digital" 

### Plan for Digital Collecting 

1. Maximize receipt and addition to the Library's collections of selected digital content submitted for copyright purposes
2. Expand digital collecting via routine modes of acquisitions
3. Focus on purchased and leased electronic resources
4. Expand use of web archiving to acquire digital content
5. Develop and implement an acquisitions program for openly available content
6. Expand collecting of appropriate datasets and other large units of content
- "Determine the manner in which research by our patrons using datasets will be supported, such as with special software and licensed or purchased content


# Transferring "Libraries of Congress" of Data (2011)

- "We currently contract with the Internet Archive to perform our large-scale web crawling"
- "For all the optimism about transmitting "Libraries of Congress" of data over networks, putting data on physical storage media and then shipping that media around remains a surprisingly competitive alternative"
- "transfer is just the initial stage in our management of the web archive data; the infrastructure demands compound when you consider the requirements for redundant storage on tape and/or spinning disk, internal network bandwidth, and processor cycles for copying, indexing, validation, and so forth" 


# The First Decade of Web Archiving at the Library of Congress (2011)
- "There are a few approaches to Web archiving: bulk or domain harvesting (for example, the National Library of Iceland archives all of .is), and selective, thematic or event-based harvesting."
