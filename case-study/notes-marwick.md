# Ethnographic and Qualitative Research on Twitter

"Because Twitter is such a vast network with so many user groups, simply
collecting a great deal of data may not be adequate for describing use beyond
simple queries" 

- Qualitative methods: interviews, ethnographic fieldwork, textual analysis
- Interviews - understanding participants' meaning-making processes
    - "interviews can be an effective way to investigate normative assumptions about
       technology"
    - "ask users to explain principles of technology to me, which can reveal a lot
       about implicit norms and social practice"
    - "I have also found it necessary to understand Twitter as part of a multiplex
       of communication options"
- Ethnographic - in-person observation and participation, over lengthy period of
  time, either online or in a particular physical location
    - "Twitter provides an articulated social graph in the form of the lists of
      follwing/followers that appears on every Twitter profile ... Examining ...
      can enable greater understanding of a particular social scene in which
      ethnographic fieldwork is being conducted"
    - "Twitter may be one node on a network of field sites which include other
      social media sites, in-person locations, and material objects ... Twitter
      can be used as the primary place to observe interactions between people
      over a period of time, but these may be transient, ephemeral, and
      difficult to pin down" 
- Textual Interpretation - qualitative coding of individual tweets to close
  readings of particular accounts
    - "In both these studies, qualititative textual analysis was used to unearth
      subtleties of interaction on Twitter which may have been missed using more
      quantitative methods" 
    - "In providing thick description of specific tweets and interactions, we
      were able to illuminate specific patterns of use that would have been
      difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain with a more automated method"

### Conclusions
"Twitter is an immensely rich site for analysis, with a diverse array of users,
multiple language communities, and a variety of subcultures who have taken to
it"


"Identifying large-scale patterns can be useful, but it can also overlook how
people do things with Twitter, and why they do them, and how they understand
them"


"Twitter is used by a relatively small number of people to begin with, and
leaves out entirely those who do not use the Internet"


"Rather than taking statistics for granted, the methods outlined ... show
alternate ways to make sense of user practices, social norms, and power
relations as they play out on Twitter, and throughout the digital world"
