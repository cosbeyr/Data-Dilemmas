# The Library and Twitter: An FAQ (2010)

"Twitter is part of the historical record of communication, news reporting, and
social trends - all of which complement the Library's existing cultural heritage
collections"
- "direct record of important events"
- "serves as a news feed with minute-by-minute headlines from major news
  sources"
- "it is a platform for citizen journalism wiht many significant events being
  first reported by eyewitnesses"
- "viewed in the aggregate, they can be a resource for future generations to
  understand life in the 21st century"

**Twitter archive** - public (no private or deleted), no linked
information (pictures or websites), six-month buffer after tweet has been
tweeted

"The Twitter collection will serve as a helpful case study as we develop
policies for research use of our digital archives"

**Questions:** will it be made public, what about privacy


# Update on the Twitter Archive (2013)

"The Library's first objectives were to acquire and preserve the 2006-10
archive; to establish a secure, sustainable process for receiving and preserving
a daily, ongoing stream of tweets through the present day; and to create a
structure for organizing the entire archive by date." 
- 170 billion tweets

"Archiving and preserving outlets such as Twitter will enable future researchers
access to a fuller picture of today's cultural norms, dialogue, trends and
events to inform scholarship, the legislative process, new works of authorship,
education and other purposes."

**2006-2010 archive:** 20 terrabytes, 21 billion tweets, 

### Building a Stable, Sustainable Archive
- First 'stream' content collected by the Library
- Gnip == the designated delivery agent for Twitter 
    - organizes the stream of tweets into hour-long segments and uploads to
      secure server for retrieval
- "Files are copied to two tape archives in geographically different locations
  as a preservation and security measure"

### Toward Providing Collection Research Access
- "Currently, executing a single search of just the fixed 2006-2010 archive on
  the Library's system could take 24 hours"
- "To achieve a significant reduction of search time, however, would require an
  extensive infrastructure of hundreds if not thousands of servers. This is
  cost-prohibitive and impractical for a public institution" 
    - something not yet achieved in the private sector (at the time of this
      publication)

* "In the near term, the Library is working to develop a basic level of access
  that can be implemented while archival access technologies catch up"
    * public-private partnerships
    * leveraging of private sector investment and capacity
    * working with Gnip: "to explore the possibility of developing a research-
      scholarship-focused interface to the archive using Gnip's existing
      historical Twitter product offerings"

# Update on the Twitter Archive (2017)

"the Library will continue to acquire tweets but will do so on a very selective
basis under the overall guidance provided in the Library's Collections Policy
Statements and associated documents."

"the tweets collected and archived will be thematic and event-based, including
events such as elections, or themes of ongoing national interest, e.g. public
policy"

- limited tweet collection
- access issues: "managing transactions that generate deletions of tweets, and
  user access issues"

### Collection Decision
- "the library has determined that its initial Twitter collection will consist
  of a twelve-year snapshot of the beginning of one of social media's most
important and transformative communication tools"


(a) The nature of Twitter has changed over time.

    i.  The volume of tweets and related transactions has evolved and increased
       dramatically since the initial agreement was signed

    ii. The Library only receives text. It does not receive images, videos or
        linked content. Tweets now are often more visual than textual, limiting
        the value of text-only collecting.

    iii. Twitter is expanding the size of tweets beyond what was originally
         described at the beginning of effort.

(b) The Library has the first 12 years of public tweets. This period documents
the rise of an important social media platform

(c) The Library generally does not collect comprehensively. Given the unknown
direction of social media when the gift was planned, the Library made an
exception for public tweets. With social media now established, the Library is
bringing its collecting practice more in line with its collection policies.

### Collection Access

"The Library will focus its efforts on preserving the Twitter collection for
future generations... The Twitter Archive may prove to be one of this
generation's most significant legacies to future generations. Future generations
will learn much about this rich period in our history, the information flows,
and social and political forces that help define the current generation" 

- "the Library has seized opportunities to collect snapshots of unique moments
  ih numan history ... These snapshots of particular moments in history often
give voice to history's silent masses: ordinary people"


# Questions / Further Inquiry 
- What about metadata (usernames, locations)?
- What happened to efforts of storing and retrieving?
- Is the selective collection approach silencing of "ordinary people"? If the
  focus is on the thematic and event-based then that probably means they are
aggregating from many sources. This is problematic if the collection is
primarily from 'Twitter verified' sources.
