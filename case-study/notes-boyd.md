# Six Provocations for Big Data
"[Big Data's] value comes from the patterns that can be derived by making
connections between pieces of data, about an individual, about individuals in
relation to others, about groups of people, or simply about the structure of
information itself" (2)

"New technologies have made it possible for a wide range of people - including
humanities and social science academics, marketers, governmental organizations,
educational institutions, and motivated individuals - to produce, share,
interact with, and organize data" (2)

### Automating Research Changes the Definition of Knowledge
"Big Data has emerged a system of knowledge that is already changing the objects
of knowledge, while also having the power to inform how we understand human
networks and community" (3)

"Why people do things, write things, or make things is erased by the sheer
volume of numerical repetition and large patterns" (4)


"Twitter and Facebook are examples of Big Data sources that offer very poor
archiving and search functions, where researchers are much more likely to focus
on something in the present or immediate past - tracking reactions to an
election, TV finale or natural disaster - because of the sheer difficulty or
impossibility of accessing older data" (4) *

"A model may be mathematically sound, an experiment may seem valid, but as soon
sa a researcher seeks to understand what it means, the process of interpretation
has begun. The design decisions that determine what will be measured also stem
from interpretation" (5)

### Bigger Data are Not Always Better Data
- Twitter does not represent 'all people'
- accounts != users (users can have multiple accounts, accounts can have
  multiple users, nonusers can access the posts from accounts, bots can have
accounts)
- "active posters" versus "listeners"
- "Twitter Inc. has revealed that 40 percent of active users sign in just to
  listen" (6)
- "it is difficult for researchers to make claims about the quality of the data
  that they are analyzing ... Regardless of the number of tweets, it is not a
representative sample as the data is skewed from the beginning" (7) 
- "The size of data being sampled should fit the research question being asked:
  in some cases, small is best"


### Not All Data Are Equivalent
- "researchers have flocked to Twitter and Facebook and other social media to
  analyze the resultant social graphs, making claims about social networks" (8)
- "the networks prdouced through social media and resulting from communication
  traces are not necessarily interchangeable with other social network data" (9)
* * "rather than indicating the presence of predictable objective patterns,
  social network sites facilitate connectedness across structural boundaries and
act as a dynamic source of change: taking a snapshot, or even witnessing a set
of traces over time does not capture the complexity of all social relations" (9) *
-  articulated and behavioral networks -- not equivalent to personal networks

### Just Because it is Accessible Doesn't Make it Ethical
- anonymous data can be deanonymized
- "it is unethical for researchers to justify their actions as ethical simply
  because the data is accessible" (11)
- "[social media users] data was created in highly context-sensitive spaces, and
  it is entirely possible that some social media users would not give permission
for their data to be used elsewhere" (11)
- "Data may be public (or semi-public) but this does not simplictically equate
  with full permission being given for all uses. There is a considerable
difference between being in public and being public, which is rarely
acknowledged by Big Data researchers" (11)


### Limited Access to Big Data Creates New Digital Divides
- "Some companies restrict access to their data entirely; others sell the
  privilege of access for high fee; and others offer small data sets to
university-based researchers. This produces considerable unevenness in the
system: those with money - or those inside the company - can produce a different
type of research than those outside" (12)
