# Analysis of Twitter and Facebook Use by the Archival Community

- "analyzes the usage patterns of 195 individual and institutional users over a
  thirty-two-day period during the summer of 2009"
- "2,926 outbound links posted to servicesd during the period"
- "three test groups: archival organizations using Facebook, archival
  organizations using Twitter, and archivists using Twitter"

"The study shows that archival organizations overwhelmingly use the services to
promote content they have created themselves, whereas archivists promote
information they find useful"
- "more frequent posting did not correlate to a larger audience"

### Introduction
"The growth in Internet reliance by genealogists is surely in part due to
  successful web marketing efforts by archives and websites ... which make
one-stop shopping viable for researchers seeking specific types of resources" 


"many university archivists were receptive to Web 2.0 technologies as a way to
promote their collections and communicate with clients"
